# Libft

Libft is a C programming project aimed at creating a personal implementation of various standard C library functions. This repository contains a collection of custom functions that aim to replicate the behavior of standard library functions.

## Functions Implemented

This project includes implementations of common functions such as:

- `ft_memset`
- `ft_strlen`
- `ft_strcpy`
- `ft_strdup`
- `ft_memcpy`
- `ft_isalpha`
- `ft_isdigit`
- `ft_atoi`
- `ft_putchar`
- and many more...

Each function is designed to behave similarly to its corresponding function in the standard C library, but with a personal implementation.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yahyaelarousy/libft.git
